<h1>The James Bond Package: </h1>

A midterm project for Network Everything (Spring 2016)

<h3> The Idea: </h3>

We plan on building a james bond style spying briefcase. The aim of the project is to create a fun tool for collecting data about the surrounding as well as raise awareness and tackle issues surrounding surveillance and privacy. In addition to collecting information about its surroundings, the briefcase is meant to be a 'live' object. We want it to react to react to its environment. An antithesis to the typical spy briefcase that is nondescript. We will add speakers and get it to respond to movements within its surrounding area - notifying people of its presence. In addition, the briefcase will report information from its sensors to a webserver and thus will be available for anyone to access.
